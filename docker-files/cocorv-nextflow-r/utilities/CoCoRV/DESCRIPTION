Description: This package performs consistent summary count based rare variant 
  burden test. This is useful when we only have sequenced cases with data. It 
  can compare the cases against public summary count data, such as gnomAD. 
  Consistent fitering is applied to make sure the same set of high quality 
  variants are used. It can also stratify cases into different ethnicity groups 
  and do stratified analysis with matched control summary counts. For recessive 
  models, it can exclude double heterozygous due to linkage disequilibrium in 
  populations. This package also provides better inflation factor estimate, 
  QQ plot, and powerful FDR control based on sampled p-values under the null
  distribution, which are different from the uniform distribution when 
  the counts are rare.
